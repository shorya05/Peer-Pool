# 🚗 Peer-Pool: A Decentralized Carpooling Platform

Peer-Pool is a peer-to-peer (P2P) **decentralized carpooling DApp** that empowers drivers by eliminating middlemen like traditional cab aggregators (e.g., Ola, Uber), who take high commissions from drivers' earnings. Built on blockchain and powered by smart contracts, Peer-Pool ensures fair payouts, transparency, and a hassle-free ride-sharing experience.

## 🧠 Why Peer-Pool?

Traditional ride-hailing platforms:
- Take large cuts from drivers' fares as commission
- Limit driver autonomy and control
- Lack transparency in fare structure

**Peer-Pool solves this by:**
- Enabling direct ride publishing by drivers
- Removing intermediaries
- Using secure and auditable smart contracts
- Accepting cryptocurrency payments for global reach
